**Decision**: Adopt a 5+1 layer Ports & Adapters model for `dev.logicojp.reviewer`:
`presentation` / `application` / `application.port` / `domain` / `infrastructure` / `shared`.
Dependencies point inward only; `domain` may import only `java.*` and `shared`.
Copilot SDK is confined to `infrastructure`; Micronaut and Jakarta are confined to
`infrastructure` + `presentation`. Port naming is `VerbNounPort`, adapter naming is
`TechNounAdapter`. Zero package cycles. ArchUnit enforces every boundary.

**Rationale**: The current flat-package layout has 6 dependency cycles and leaks the
Copilot SDK into 8 packages, making the domain untestable without the SDK and the CLI
unable to evolve independently. A strict inward-only dependency rule with a machine-
enforced ArchUnit gate is the minimum structure that makes those violations
impossible to reintroduce. Any violation is classified CRITICAL.

**Decision**: Cycle-breaking strategy for the layered rebuild — move shared domain types
(`ReviewResult`, `AgentConfig`, `SkillDefinition`, `SharedCircuitBreaker`) into `domain`,
and break the `TemplateService` hub by defining `LoadTemplatePort` in `application.port`
with an infrastructure adapter. Service-to-service dependencies are inverted via outbound
ports rather than direct imports.

**Rationale**: Analysis of 120 files across 15 packages found 10 dependency cycles (4 more
than the recon estimate of 6). `TemplateService` alone is the hub of 5 of them and is
imported by 8+ classes across 4 packages, so a single port extraction removes half the
cycle graph. The remaining cycles all trace to shared mutable domain types living in
feature packages (`ReviewResult` in `report.core`, `AgentConfig` in `agent`); relocating
them to `domain` makes the dependencies inward-only by construction. Framework leakage
measured at 20 files (Copilot SDK), 24 (Micronaut), 32 (Jakarta), 50 (SLF4J).
