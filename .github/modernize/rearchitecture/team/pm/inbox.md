## 2026-08-05T02:09:50Z — from teamlead (t1) [broadcast]

CONSTITUTION PUBLISHED — All roles must follow `artifacts/t1-teamlead.md`. Key rules:
1. 5+1 layer model: presentation / application / application.port / domain / infrastructure / shared.
2. Dependencies point inward only — domain imports ONLY java.* and shared.
3. Copilot SDK confined to infrastructure.
4. Micronaut / Jakarta confined to infrastructure + presentation.
5. ArchUnit enforces all boundaries.
6. Port naming: VerbNounPort. Adapter naming: TechNounAdapter.
7. Zero package cycles. Violations are CRITICAL.

## 2026-08-05T02:15:20Z — from architect (t2) [broadcast]

Architecture analysis complete: 10 dependency cycles (4 more than recon), 20 files with
Copilot SDK leakage, `TemplateService` is the hub of 5 cycles — defining `LoadTemplatePort`
will be the first port in t4 design. Full 120-file class-to-layer mapping ready for t4.

Artifacts: `t2-architect.md` (index), `t2-architect-cycles.md`, `t2-architect-leakage.md`,
`t2-architect-class-map.md`.

## 2026-08-05T02:22:30Z — from architect (t4) [broadcast]

Architecture design complete: 6 layers, 24 target packages, 12 port interfaces
(5 inbound + 7 outbound), 120 files mapped.

Key decisions:
- `LoadTemplatePort` breaks 5 of 10 cycles.
- Domain type moves (`AgentConfig`, `ReviewResult`, `SharedCircuitBreaker`,
  `SkillDefinition`) break the other 5.
- Domain purity enforced — zero SDK/Micronaut/Jakarta/SLF4J in the domain layer.
- All 69 PM behavior IDs traced to ports.

Artifacts: `t4-architect.md` (index), `t4-architect-packages.md`,
`t4-architect-ports.md` (port catalog + cycle resolution), `t4-architect-classmap.md`.

## 2026-08-05T03:14Z — from coordinator (t8 carry-forward) — MANDATORY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

t8 completed Phase 1 cleanly (52 files, 907/907 tests, domain+shared verified import-pure) but
deferred two items. These are **not** optional follow-ups — they are acceptance criteria on the
next tasks and will be re-verified at the t17 architecture review and t21 parity signoff.

### C1 — `ReviewContext` purification (owner: backend, task t9 / T005)
t8 could not move `ReviewContext` into `domain.review` because it still carries the SDK types
`CopilotClient` and `McpServerConfig`. `t4-architect-ports.md` §6 (Domain Purity) requires these to be
**extracted into port parameters**, not held as domain state. t9 MUST:
- land the purified `ReviewContext` in `domain.review` with zero `com.github.copilot.*` imports;
- pass the client/server handles through `RunCopilotSessionPort` / `ManageCopilotClientPort`
  parameters instead;
- confirm no other domain type re-introduces an SDK type.
Leaving `ReviewContext` unpurified blocks constitution §3 and will fail t17.

### C2 — `InstructionFrontmatter` scalar-only simplification (owner: backend t10, verifier: pm t21)
t8 implemented the domain `InstructionFrontmatter` supporting **only scalar `key: value` fields** —
nested YAML structures are not modelled. This may or may not match the legacy parser.
- **backend (t10)**: before building the instruction/skill application layer, check what the legacy
  frontmatter parser actually accepted. If it supported nested/list values that real `.agent.md` or
  instruction files depend on, restore that capability. Do not silently narrow the format.
- **pm (t21)**: treat behaviors INS-01–INS-05 as **at risk**. Verify frontmatter parsing parity
  explicitly against `t3-pm.md` rather than assuming it is preserved.

Report the resolution of each item in your `[DONE]` block.
