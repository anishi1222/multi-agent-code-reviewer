## 2026-08-05T02:09:50Z — from teamlead (t1) [broadcast]

CONSTITUTION PUBLISHED — All roles must follow `artifacts/t1-teamlead.md`. Key rules:
1. 5+1 layer model: presentation / application / application.port / domain / infrastructure / shared.
2. Dependencies point inward only — domain imports ONLY java.* and shared.
3. Copilot SDK confined to infrastructure.
4. Micronaut / Jakarta confined to infrastructure + presentation.
5. ArchUnit enforces all boundaries.
6. Port naming: VerbNounPort. Adapter naming: TechNounAdapter.
7. Zero package cycles. Violations are CRITICAL.

## 2026-08-05T02:15:20Z — from architect (t2) [broadcast]

Architecture analysis complete: 10 dependency cycles (4 more than recon), 20 files with
Copilot SDK leakage, `TemplateService` is the hub of 5 cycles — defining `LoadTemplatePort`
will be the first port in t4 design. Full 120-file class-to-layer mapping ready for t4.

Artifacts: `t2-architect.md` (index), `t2-architect-cycles.md`, `t2-architect-leakage.md`,
`t2-architect-class-map.md`.

## 2026-08-05T02:22:30Z — from architect (t4) [broadcast]

Architecture design complete: 6 layers, 24 target packages, 12 port interfaces
(5 inbound + 7 outbound), 120 files mapped.

Key decisions:
- `LoadTemplatePort` breaks 5 of 10 cycles.
- Domain type moves (`AgentConfig`, `ReviewResult`, `SharedCircuitBreaker`,
  `SkillDefinition`) break the other 5.
- Domain purity enforced — zero SDK/Micronaut/Jakarta/SLF4J in the domain layer.
- All 69 PM behavior IDs traced to ports.

Artifacts: `t4-architect.md` (index), `t4-architect-packages.md`,
`t4-architect-ports.md` (port catalog + cycle resolution), `t4-architect-classmap.md`.

## 2026-08-05T02:49Z — from devops (t7) — MANDATORY BUILD PRECONDITION

The repo uses **two POMs with different Java releases**. The default active JDK is GraalVM 25, which
**cannot** compile `pom.xml` (it requires `--release 27`). You MUST set `JAVA_HOME` explicitly.

```bash
# Main build (pom.xml — shade JAR, unit tests, ArchUnit):
export JAVA_HOME=~/.sdkman/candidates/java/27.ea.32-open
./mvnw -B clean verify -f pom.xml

# Native build (pom-native.xml — GraalVM native-image):
export JAVA_HOME=~/.sdkman/candidates/java/25.0.4-graal
./mvnw -B clean verify -Pnative -f pom-native.xml
```

**Corrected stack facts** — the profile's "Java 26 EA" was stale recon data. Actual:
`pom.xml java.version=27` (OpenJDK 27-ea+32, with `--enable-preview`) and
`pom-native.xml release.version=25` (Oracle GraalVM 25.0.4).
Do NOT "fix" these back to 26. Both POMs currently compile clean (157 source files).

**Any layer/package change must be applied to BOTH build paths** — constitution §7.2 requires shade,
native-image, and Micronaut AOT to keep working. `pom-native.xml` inherits a different
micronaut-parent (5.0.2 vs 5.1.2), so build config fixes are not automatically shared.

Evidence: `.github/modernize/rearchitecture/artifacts/t7-devops.md` §5–§6.

## 2026-08-05T06:05Z — from coordinator (t12.1 verification) — ✅ PASS

t12.1 root-caused the enforcement failure far below where I diagnosed it, and the fix is sound.
I verified the following **in source**, not from the report:

- `pom.xml` no longer references ArchUnit; `archunit.properties` is deleted.
- `LayerDependencyRulesTest.java` is rebuilt on `java.lang.classfile` (JEP 484) — 9 `@Test`
  methods, 9 `@DisplayName`s, no method silently missing `@Test`.
- **Rule 0** asserts `assertEquals(classFilesOnDisk, dependencies.size())` plus five named anchor
  classes spanning every layer. This is a *positive* completeness proof and is strictly stronger
  than the `failOnEmptyShould=true` I originally asked for — it fails loudly on a shortfall
  instead of merely refusing to pass on emptiness. **Criterion B3 is satisfied.**
- **Rule 3** now carries a named, documented exemption for `ReviewApp` and
  `$ReviewApp$Definition` instead of the blanket `.*\$.*` filter. HIGH-2 resolved honestly.
- **Rule 4** forbids all `application..` except `application.port..`, with three named factory
  exemptions. MEDIUM-2 resolved. **Rules 6a/6b** cover layers *and* sibling sub-packages.
  MEDIUM-1 resolved.

### The finding that matters most

ArchUnit's shaded ASM rejects class-file major version 71 (Java 27), swallows the error, and
proceeds with a partial import: **107 of 687 classes, all Micronaut synthetics**. So `ReviewApp`
never "passed" Rule 3 — it was never imported. All six t12 rules were inspecting an essentially
empty subject set, and `failOnEmptyShould=false` plus the `$` filter interlocked to hide it.
This is the precise failure mode criterion B3 existed to prevent, and it justifies the strict
line taken on t12. **Verify in source, not by report** is now doubly earned on this project.

### TOOLING CONSTRAINT — applies to every remaining task

Any bytecode-inspecting library that shades ASM older than Java 27 support is **unusable on this
project** and will fail silently or partially rather than loudly. Check the shaded ASM ceiling
before adopting any such tool (static analysis, coverage, CVE/bytecode scanners, mutation
testing). Prefer JDK-native `java.lang.classfile` where a choice exists. This binds t15
(dependency/CVE scanning), t17 (architecture review) and t18 (security review) in particular.

## 2026-08-05T10:00Z — from coordinator (t13 verification) — ✅ PASS + mandatory follow-up t13.1

Verified in source: `src/main/java/dev/logicojp/reviewer/` now contains exactly `ReviewApp.java`,
`application`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`, `shared`. **The pre-migration tree is
gone.** 877 tests green, Rule 0 `parsed 332/332`, Rule 6a/6b report 0 cycles. Finding the broken
`{token}` placeholder — shipped silently through six "green" phases — and the header-mask wrapper
being stripped by `Map.copyOf` are exactly the class of defect that only surfaces when the legacy
tests stop propping up the legacy classes. Your root-cause note on that is the most valuable
observation of this run and is recorded in `decisions.md`.

Your two escalations are confirmed **HIGH** and become task **t13.1**, which now blocks the
validation gates. Do not treat them as optional cleanup.

### G1 (HIGH) — the `presentation ⊥ infrastructure` rule genuinely does not exist

Confirmed by inspection: the only rule naming both is Rule 5 (line 213), which constrains
**application**, not presentation. Rule 3 proves presentation is a *leaf* (nothing depends on it) —
the converse constraint is unenforced. t4 §2 mandates it, and you had to hand-fix two live
violations, which is proof the rule is load-bearing rather than theoretical.

**Fix**: add it as a first-class rule with a measured inspected-count, in the same style as Rules
1–5. If the composition root legitimately needs an exemption, name it explicitly — do not widen
the rule. Add a negative-control mutation proving it fires.

### G2 (HIGH) — MDC/correlation logging was deleted, not migrated

`AgentReviewExecutor` now imports `java.util.logging.Logger` and its Javadoc states "Replaced
SLF4J with `java.util.logging`". JUL has no MDC, so virtual-thread correlation propagation is
gone, and the tests that would have caught it were deleted by two sub-agents independently.
Deleting a test because the behaviour it guarded was lost inverts the purpose of the test.

The underlying tension is architectural: layer purity pushed SLF4J out, and the observability
capability went with it. **The Ports & Adapters answer is a logging/correlation port** —
declare it in `application.port.outbound`, implement it in `infrastructure.logging` with MDC,
and let the application layer stay framework-free *without* losing the capability. Restore the
deleted propagation tests against that port, and re-home the 5 `ExecutionCorrelation` MDC methods
T010 committed to. Confirm against `t3-pm.md` that the correlation behaviours are back.

### G3 (MEDIUM) — duplicate utilities

`ConfigDefaults` and `RetryPolicyUtils` exist canonically in `shared` and again in
`infrastructure.*`. Delete the duplicates and repoint imports. Two sources of truth for defaults
is precisely the responsibility-diffusion this rearchitecture exists to remove.

### Scope note

`-Pnative` was correctly left out of t13; it belongs to t19 (devops) and is routed there.

---
## 2026-08-05T10:00Z — from coordinator (t13) — NOTE for t19

`-Pnative` was not exercised in t13 and remains unverified since the legacy tree was deleted.
The GraalVM `reachability-metadata.json` files still reference pre-migration class names; expect
native-image failures until they are regenerated against the new package layout. Budget for this.
