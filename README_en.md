# Multi-Agent Code Reviewer

A parallel code review application using multiple AI agents with GitHub Copilot SDK for Java!

## Features

- **Parallel Multi-Agent Execution**: Simultaneous review from security, code quality, performance, and best practices perspectives
- **GitHub Repository / Local Directory Support**: Review source code from GitHub repositories or local directories
- **Flexible Agent Definitions**: Define agents in GitHub Copilot format (.agent.md)
- **Agent Skill Support**: Define individual skills for agents to execute specific tasks
- **External Configuration Files**: Agent definitions can be swapped without rebuilding
- **Per-Pass Session ID Naming**: Session IDs use `{agent}_{currentPass}of{totalPasses}_{invocationTimestamp}` for traceability
- **Isolated Session Mode**: Disable shared session reuse across passes with `--no-shared-session`
- **LLM Model Selection**: Use different models for review, report generation, and summary generation
- **Structured Review Results**: Consistent format with Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Executive Summary Generation**: Management-facing report aggregating all review results
- **GraalVM Support**: Native binary generation via Native Image
- **Reasoning Model Support**: Automatic reasoning effort configuration for Claude Opus, o3, o4-mini, etc.
- **Multi-Pass Review**: Each agent performs multiple review passes and merges results for improved coverage
- **Content Sanitization**: Automatic removal of LLM preamble text and chain-of-thought leakage from review output
- **Default Model Externalization**: Configure the default model in `application.yml` (changeable without rebuild)
- **Token Lifetime Minimization**: Runtime token handling is narrowed to execution boundaries to reduce in-memory exposure time
- **DI-Consistent Service Construction**: `CopilotService` is unified to DI constructor usage (no no-arg path)
- **Rubber-Duck Peer Discussion Mode**: Two-model dialogue per agent — a primary model and a peer model debate findings across configurable rounds before producing a synthesized final review

## Latest Remediation Status

All review findings from 2026-02-16 through 2026-05-28 review cycles have been fully addressed.

- 2026-05-28 (v2026.05.28-ci-release-hardening): CI and release hardening — changed GitHub Actions workflow defaults to `permissions: {}`, granted `contents: read` only to build jobs and `contents: write` only to the release-publishing job, removed unnecessary release checkout by setting `GH_REPO`, eliminated duplicate OWASP Dependency Check execution from `Supply Chain Guard` so deep auditing is owned by `Dependency Audit`, switched CodeQL Java/Kotlin analysis to `build-mode: none`, fixed dependency submission permissions, refreshed Actions/Maven plugin dependencies, and updated `CopilotCliPathResolver` tests for the latest constructor API.
- 2026-05-15 (v2026.05.15-runtime-compat): Runtime compatibility and report-accuracy fixes — aligned structured concurrency utilities with the JDK 27 `StructuredTaskScope<T, R, R_X>` signature while preserving await-all behavior, removed macOS-specific `/bin/true` test dependency, expanded trusted CLI real-path allowlist for Homebrew `Cellar`/`Caskroom` (fixing both `gh auth token` fallback and `copilot` discovery), normalized Copilot SDK log-level mapping (`warn` -> `warning`), fixed deny-all permission serialization by returning typed `REJECTED`, and excluded "no findings" placeholder blocks from findings aggregation. Verified with `mvn clean package` (830 tests passing).
- 2026-05-15 (v2026.05.15-sdk-refactor): Copilot SDK for Java native-feature alignment refactor (Phases 1–3) — typed MCP server handoff with `McpHttpServerConfig` instead of `Map<String, Object>` casts (Phase 1, commit `96df653`); replaced subprocess-based `CopilotCliHealthChecker` with SDK `client.getStatus()` / `getAuthStatus()` based `CopilotHealthProbe`, set `setAutoRestart(true)` and env-driven `setLogLevel(...)`, rewrote `DoctorCommand` on top of the SDK probe (Phase 2, commit `b657c64` + corrections in `a9310fc`); migrated `ReviewSessionMessageSender`, `ReviewAgent`, and `RubberDuckDialogueExecutor` from custom event subscription + idle-timeout watchdog to SDK `session.sendAndWait(MessageOptions, timeoutMs)` with a defensive `AssistantMessageEvent` accumulator for the empty-final-response edge case (Phase 3b, commit `868aafe`); deleted `IdleTimeoutScheduler`, `EventSubscriptions`, `ReviewSessionEvents`, `ContentCollector`, `SessionEventException` and pruned `sharedScheduler` plumbing from orchestrator/context, reducing `AgentTuningConfig` and `BufferSettings` to a single field (Phase 3c, commit `293f2e5`). Net change across phases: ~ -1,100 production LoC. Verified with `mvn test` (820 passing; one pre-existing `/bin/true` env-dependent error in `CliPathResolverTest`).
- 2026-04-30 (v2026.04.30-copilot-sdk-stable): Copilot SDK stable migration and CI alignment — upgraded `copilot.sdk.version` from preview `0.3.0-java-preview.1` to stable `0.3.0-java.2`, normalized GitHub Actions `JDK_VERSION` from `26.0.1` to `26` across `ci.yml`/`codeql.yml`/`dependency-audit.yml`/`release.yml`, pinned the CycloneDX Maven plugin to `2.9.1` in the release workflow with the SBOM step refactored for readability, and granted job-level `permissions: contents: write` to the `publish-release` job so `gh release create` succeeds under the workflow-level least-privilege default (`contents: read`). Verified with `mvn clean package` on Java 26
- 2026-04-30 (v2026.04.30-micronaut5-snapshot): Micronaut 5 SNAPSHOT tracking — upgraded `io.micronaut.platform:micronaut-parent` and `micronaut.version` to `5.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, added Sonatype Central Snapshots repository for both dependencies and plugins, temporarily disabled the SNAPSHOT-blocking enforcer rule with an annotated TODO, and configured `micronaut-maven-plugin` with `<configurationValidation><failOnNotPresent>false</failOnNotPresent></configurationValidation>` so the new Micronaut 5 strict validator does not misclassify `-Amicronaut.processing.*` annotation processor arguments as unknown configuration properties. Verified with `mvn clean package` (BUILD SUCCESS) and 829 passing tests on Java 26 (Oracle 26.0.1)
- 2026-04-23 (v2026.04.23-copilot-sdk-compat): Copilot SDK compatibility alignment — upgraded `copilot.sdk.version` to `0.3.0-java-preview.1`, migrated event imports from `com.github.copilot.sdk.events.*` to `com.github.copilot.sdk.generated.*`, and updated MCP server handoff to satisfy the new `setMcpServers(Map<String, McpServerConfig>)` type requirement. Verified with `./mvnw -q -DskipTests compile`
- 2026-04-14 (v2026.04.14-model-auth-check): Model/auth-check alignment — updated bundled agent frontmatter models from `GPT-5.3-Codex` to `claude-opus-4.6-1m`, kept default model alignment consistent across runtime config and bundled agents, and improved Copilot CLI auth pre-check fallback compatibility (PR #121)
- 2026-04-14 (v2026.04.14-rubber-duck): Rubber-duck peer discussion review mode added — introduced agent-level two-model dialogue with synthesized final output, CLI/config support (`--rubber-duck`, `--dialogue-rounds`, `--peer-model`, `reviewer.rubber-duck.*`), timeout/mode handling alignment for rubber-duck execution, and dependency update `org.owasp:dependency-check-maven` 12.2.1 (PRs #119/#118)
- 2026-03-18 (v2026.03.18-auth): OAuth device-flow alignment — switched Copilot auth to logged-in user flow, removed `GITHUB_TOKEN`-centric guidance from runtime/CLI/docs, and synchronized README EN/JA + release notes. Verified with `mvn clean test` (743 passing)
- 2026-03-05 (v2026.03.05-notes): Performance/security improvements and codebase cleanup — `LocalFileCandidateProcessor` double-buffering avoidance, `GitHubTokenResolver` child process token propagation prevention, `CliPathResolver` trusted directory validation, `FrontmatterParser` YAML DoS resistance, `SensitiveHeaderMasking` pattern expansion, Java 26 migration, structured concurrency path unification, `CopilotPermissionHandlers` centralization, obsolete custom instruction class removal. PRs #85/#86/#87/#88/#89/#90 merged
- 2026-03-05 (v2026.03.05): **Breaking change** — Discontinued custom instruction support, migrated to agent skills only. Removed `--instructions`/`--no-instructions`/`--no-prompts` CLI options. Created 4 new agent skills from custom instructions (java-best-practices, java-bug-patterns, spring-boot-review, vuejs3-review). Completed all 16 complexity refactorings (5 HIGH + 9 MEDIUM + 2 LOW). Aligned micronaut.version with parent 4.10.9
- 2026-03-04 (v2026.03.04):Security fixes & dependency updates — pinned jackson-core to 2.21.1 (GHSA-72hv-8253-57qq), replaced ReDoS-prone regex with loop (CodeQL alert #9), bumped Copilot SDK to 1.0.10, bumped actions/checkout to 6.0.2, introduced OWASP Dependency Check in CI. PRs #75/#76/#77/#78/#79/#80 merged
- 2026-03-03 (v2026.03.03):Report generation flow improvement — generate per-pass review reports without overall summary, merge after all passes complete, recount finding severity from the merged report content to append an accurate overall summary, and deduplicate identical findings across agents in the executive summary with review category listing. Code-quality remediation including DRY/responsibility separation/Optional/type-safety improvements. PRs #72/#73 merged
- 2026-03-02 (v2026.03.02-notes): Report merge remediation finalization — unified duplicate-finding merge behavior, enforced merged-findings-based overall summary generation across all report paths, completed post-merge summary behavior alignment in PRs #57/#58/#59, and updated Micronaut to 4.10.9
- 2026-02-19 (v12): Best-practices remediation — simplified `TemplateService` cache synchronization with deterministic LRU behavior, replaced `SkillService` manual executor-cache management with Caffeine eviction + close-on-evict, abstracted CLI token input handling (`CliParsing.TokenInput`) from direct system I/O, simplified `ContentCollector` joined-content cache locking, improved section parsing readability in `AgentMarkdownParser`, made multi-pass start logging in `ReviewExecutionModeRunner` accurate, completed delegation methods in `GithubMcpConfig` map wrappers, simplified `ReviewResult` default timestamp handling, removed FQCN utility usage in `SkillExecutor`, and clarified concurrency/threading design intent in `CopilotService` and `ReviewOrchestrator`
- 2026-02-19 (v11): Code quality remediation — centralized token hashing via shared `TokenHashUtils`, unified orchestrator failure-result generation with `ReviewResult.failedResults(...)`, extracted orchestrator nested types (`OrchestratorConfig`, `PromptTexts`, and collaborator interfaces/records) into top-level package types, refactored scoped-instruction loading to avoid stream-side-effect try/catch blocks, introduced grouped execution settings (`ConcurrencySettings`, `TimeoutSettings`, `RetrySettings`, `BufferSettings`) with factory access, removed dead code (`ReviewResultPipeline.collectFromFutures`) and unused similarity field, and added dedicated command tests for `ReviewCommand` / `SkillCommand`
- 2026-02-19 (v10): Performance + WAF security hardening — eliminated redundant finding-key extraction in merge flow, added prefix-indexed near-duplicate lookup, optimized local file read buffer sizing, precompiled fallback whitespace regex, introduced structured security audit logging, enforced SDK WARN level even in verbose mode, applied owner-only report output permissions on POSIX, added Maven `dependencyConvergence`, and added weekly OWASP dependency-audit workflow
- 2026-02-19 (v9): Security follow-up closure — expanded suspicious-pattern validation for agent definitions to all prompt-injected fields, strengthened MCP header masking paths (`entrySet`/`values` stringification), and reduced token exposure by deferring `--token -` stdin materialization to resolution time
- 2026-02-19 (v8): Naming-rule alignment — synchronized executive summary output to `reports/{owner}/{repo}/executive_summary_yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss.md` (CLI invocation timestamp) and aligned README EN/JA examples + tests

## Release Update Procedure (Template)

Reference checklist: `reports/anishi1222/multi-agent-code-reviewer/documentation_sync_checklist_2026-02-17.md`

1. Add a new date section to `RELEASE_NOTES_en.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES_ja.md` with matching structure.
2. Create and push an annotated tag (for example: `vYYYY.MM.DD-notes`).
3. Publish a GitHub Release from the tag and include EN/JA notes summary.
4. Update `README_en.md` and `README_ja.md` with release references and URLs.

## Release Operation Checklist

- [ ] Add the same release date section to `RELEASE_NOTES_en.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES_ja.md`.
- [ ] Update release references in `README_en.md` and `README_ja.md`.
- [ ] Commit on a feature/docs branch and open a PR (do not push directly to `main`).
- [ ] Confirm required checks are green (Supply Chain Guard, Build and Test, Build Native Image, dependency-review, submit-maven).
- [ ] Merge the PR and fast-forward local `main`.
- [ ] Create and push an annotated tag: `git tag -a vYYYY.MM.DD-notes -m "Release notes update for YYYY-MM-DD"` then `git push origin vYYYY.MM.DD-notes`.
- [ ] Create GitHub Release from the tag with EN/JA summary notes.

## Requirements

- **JDK 27** (preview features enabled for runtime commands)
- **GraalVM** (optional, only required for `-Pnative` native-image builds)
- GitHub Copilot CLI 0.0.407 or later
- GitHub CLI login (`gh auth login`) for repository access
- GitHub Copilot CLI login (`gh copilot -- login` or `copilot login`) for Copilot SDK access

## Supply Chain Policy

This repository enforces dependency and build hygiene in both Maven and GitHub Actions.

- Maven validate/build fails when checksum verification fails for Central artifacts.
- SNAPSHOT dependencies/plugins are blocked by Maven Enforcer.
- PR dependency review fails on vulnerability severity `moderate` or higher.
- PR dependency review denies these licenses: `GPL-2.0`, `GPL-3.0`, `AGPL-3.0`, `LGPL-2.1`, `LGPL-3.0`.
- `Supply Chain Guard` runs Maven `validate` policy checks without duplicating OWASP vulnerability scanning.
- `Dependency Audit` owns OWASP `dependency-check-maven` execution via `mvn -Psecurity-audit verify`.

Recommended branch protection required checks:

- `Supply Chain Guard`
- `Build and Test`
- `Dependency Review`

### Installing the SDKMAN-managed JDK

Using SDKMAN:

```bash
sdk env install
sdk env

# Confirm active Java version
java -version
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/multi-agent-reviewer.git
cd multi-agent-reviewer

# Build (JAR file)
./mvnw clean package

# Build native image (optional)
./mvnw clean package -Pnative
```

### Test Troubleshooting

If tests fail with `NoSuchMethodError` for synthetic methods such as `access$0`, run a clean rebuild to remove stale class outputs:

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

## Usage

> Note: This project uses Java preview features. Run the JVM JAR with `--enable-preview`.

### Security Runtime Notes

When running on the JVM in production and handling GitHub tokens, consider:

```bash
java --enable-preview \
  -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism \
  -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError \
  -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar run --repo owner/repository --all
```

- `-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism`: helps reduce token exposure via runtime attach/debug interfaces.
- `-XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`: prevents automatic heap dumps that can contain token `String` data.
- If your operations require heap dumps, write them to a tightly access-controlled location and keep retention short.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run review with all agents (GitHub repository)
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all

# Review a local directory
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --local ./my-project \
  --all

# Run only specific agents
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --agents security,performance

# Explicitly specify LLM models
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all \
  --review-model gpt-4.1 \
  --summary-model claude-sonnet-4

# Run with isolated sessions per pass
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all \
  --no-shared-session

# List available agents
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  list
```

### List Subcommand

Displays a list of available agents. Additional directories can be specified with `--agents-dir`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` | Path to the Copilot CLI binary | Auto-detected from PATH |
| `GH_CLI_PATH` | Path to the GitHub CLI binary | Auto-detected from PATH |
| `GH_AUTH_FALLBACK_ENABLED` | Enable fallback from stdin token to `gh auth token` | false |

`/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/Cellar`, `/opt/homebrew/Cellar`, `/usr/local/Caskroom`, `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom`.

```bash
gh auth login
gh copilot -- login
```

If available in your environment, `copilot login` can be used instead of `gh copilot -- login`.

### Session Behavior

By default, multi-pass reviews reuse one shared session per agent. To isolate each pass in its own session, use `--no-shared-session`.

```bash
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all \
  --no-shared-session
```

### Local Directory Review

You can review source code from a local directory even when you cannot access a GitHub repository.

```bash
# Review a local project
java -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --local /path/to/project \
  --all
```

### Review Inputs

Custom instruction inputs via CLI were removed in v2026.03.05. Use agent skills under `.github/skills/` to provide domain-specific review guidance.

### Output Example

Reports are generated under the output base directory in a subdirectory corresponding to the review target plus the CLI invocation timestamp.

**GitHub repository** (`--repo owner/repository`):
```
./reports/
└── owner/
    └── repository/
      ├── executive_summary_2026-02-19-18-38-42.md
      └── 2026-02-19-18-38-42/
        ├── security-report.md
        ├── code-quality-report.md
        ├── performance-report.md
        └── best-practices-report.md
```

**Local directory** (`--local /path/to/my-project`):
```
./reports/
└── my-project/
  ├── executive_summary_2026-02-19-18-38-42.md
  └── 2026-02-19-18-38-42/
    ├── security-report.md
    ├── code-quality-report.md
    ├── performance-report.md
    └── best-practices-report.md
```

Use `-o` / `--output` to change the output base directory (default: `./reports`).

Pass-level intermediate reports are written under `.checkpoints/passes` during execution and cleaned up automatically when the CLI exits.

## Configuration

Customize application behavior via `application.yml`.

```yaml

### External Configuration Override

When running as a fat JAR or Native Image, you can override the built-in `application.yml` without rebuilding.

**Place `application.yml` in the working directory:**

```bash
# Fat JAR
cp application.yml ./
java -jar multi-agent-code-reviewer.jar

# Native Image
cp application.yml ./
./multi-agent-code-reviewer
```

**Or specify an explicit path via system property:**

```bash
# Fat JAR
java -Dmicronaut.config.files=/path/to/application.yml -jar multi-agent-code-reviewer.jar

# Native Image
./multi-agent-code-reviewer -Dmicronaut.config.files=/path/to/application.yml
```

**Or override individual properties via environment variables:**

```bash
export REVIEWER_MODELS_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4
export REVIEWER_EXECUTION_PARALLELISM=8
java -jar multi-agent-code-reviewer.jar
```

> **Note:** The external `application.yml` only needs to contain the properties you want to override — you do not need to copy the entire file.

Configuration is resolved in the following priority order (highest first):

1. CLI options (`--review-model`, `--parallelism`, etc.)
2. System properties (`-Dreviewer.models.default-model=...`)
3. Environment variables (`REVIEWER_MODELS_DEFAULT_MODEL=...`)
4. External `application.yml` (working directory or `-Dmicronaut.config.files`)
5. Built-in `application.yml` (inside the JAR / Native Image)
6. Hardcoded defaults in record constructors

### Model Configuration Priority

Models are resolved in the following priority order:

1. **Individual model settings** (`review-model`, `report-model`, `summary-model`) take highest priority
2. **Default model** (`default-model`) — fallback when no individual setting is specified
3. **Hardcoded constant** (`ModelConfig.DEFAULT_MODEL`) — final fallback when nothing is configured in YAML

### Multi-Pass Review

Each agent can perform multiple review passes, merging the results to catch issues that a single pass might miss.

- **`review-passes`** controls the number of review passes per agent (default: `1`)
- All passes are submitted concurrently to the Virtual Thread pool, with `parallelism` controlling the maximum concurrent tasks
- Example: 4 agents × 2 passes = 8 tasks queued in parallel; with `parallelism=4`, up to 4 run concurrently
- Duplicate findings within the same agent are aggregated into a single deduplicated report
- Aggregated output can include pass-detection information to preserve traceability for repeated findings
- If some passes fail, results from the successful passes are still used
- The executive summary is generated from the merged, multi-pass results

### Retry Behavior

When an agent review fails due to timeout or empty response, it is automatically retried.

- **Timeout is per-attempt, not cumulative**: `agent-timeout-minutes` applies independently to each attempt. For example, with `agent-timeout-minutes: 20` and `max-retries: 2`, the agent will try up to 3 times (initial + 2 retries) × 20 minutes each = up to 60 minutes total
- **Returns immediately on success**: If any attempt succeeds, remaining retries are skipped
- **Set `max-retries: 0`** to disable retries
- Retried on: timeout (`TimeoutException`), empty response, SDK exceptions

### Rubber-Duck Peer Discussion Mode

Each agent can optionally run in **rubber-duck mode**, where two different LLM models debate review findings in a multi-round dialogue before producing a synthesized final review.

```bash
# Enable rubber-duck mode for all agents
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all \
  --rubber-duck \
  --peer-model gpt-4.1

# With custom dialogue rounds
java --enable-preview -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  run \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --all \
  --rubber-duck \
  --peer-model gpt-4.1 \
  --dialogue-rounds 3
```

**How it works:**
1. **Session A** (agent's model) performs the initial review.
2. **Session B** (peer model) provides a peer review of Session A's findings.
3. Subsequent rounds alternate counter-arguments between the two models.
4. After all rounds, a synthesis prompt merges both perspectives into a single unified review.

**Key constraints:**
- The **peer model must differ** from the agent's review model — same-model pairing is rejected.
- When rubber-duck mode is enabled, **multi-pass review is forced to 1 pass** per agent. The dialogue itself replaces multi-pass coverage.
- Timeout is automatically scaled based on the number of dialogue rounds.
- Specifying `--peer-model` or `--dialogue-rounds` on the CLI **auto-enables** rubber-duck mode (no need to also pass `--rubber-duck`).

**Synthesis strategies** (configurable via `reviewer.rubber-duck.synthesis-strategy`):
- `last-responder` (default): The synthesis prompt is sent to the last active session (Session B).
- `dedicated-session`: A new third session is created specifically for synthesis.

**Per-agent configuration:** Rubber-duck settings can also be specified per-agent in `.agent.md` frontmatter (see Agent Definition File section).

### Agent Directories

The following directories are automatically searched:

- `./agents/` - Default directory
- `./.github/agents/` - Alternative directory

Additional directories can be specified with the `--agents-dir` option.

### Agent Definition File (`.agent.md`)

Following the GitHub Copilot Custom Agent format, all section names are in English. Recognized sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `## Role` | Agent role / system prompt |
| `## Instruction` | Review instruction prompt |
| `## Focus Areas` | List of review focus areas |
| `## Output Format` | Output format specification |

In `Instruction`, you can use placeholders: `${repository}`, `${displayName}`, `${focusAreas}`.

Additional frontmatter fields for rubber-duck mode:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `peer-model` | string | *(global config)* | Per-agent peer model override |
| `rubber-duck` | boolean | `false` | Enable rubber-duck mode for this agent |
| `dialogue-rounds` | int | `0` (defer to global) | Per-agent dialogue rounds override |
| `language` | string | `ja` | Template language for rubber-duck prompts (`ja`/`en`) |

## GraalVM Native Image

To build as a native binary:

```bash
# Build native image
./mvnw clean package -Pnative

# Run
./target/review run --repo owner/repository --all
```

### Generating Reflection Configuration (First Build / After Dependency Updates)

The Copilot SDK internally uses Jackson Databind for JSON-RPC communication. Because GraalVM Native Image restricts reflection, reflection configuration must be registered in advance for the SDK's internal DTO classes.

If the configuration is missing, the Native Image binary will time out when communicating with the Copilot CLI (this does not occur with the FAT JAR). This happens because Jackson performs JSON serialization/deserialization via reflection, and in a Native Image environment, metadata for unregistered classes is inaccessible. Exceptions are silently caught inside the SDK, leaving `CompletableFuture` instances permanently incomplete.

Use the GraalVM **tracing agent** to automatically collect the required reflection information from an actual execution.

```bash
# 1. Build the FAT JAR first
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# 2. Run with the tracing agent to auto-generate reflection configuration
#    Use config-merge-dir to merge with existing configuration
java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image \
     -jar target/multi-agent-reviewer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
     run --repo owner/repository --all

# 3. Verify the generated configuration
ls src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/
# reflect-config.json, resource-config.json, proxy-config.json, etc. are generated/updated

# 4. Rebuild as Native Image
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -DskipTests
```

> **Note**: Use `config-merge-dir` instead of `config-output-dir` to merge with existing configurations (e.g., Logback) rather than overwriting them. Also, run all agents (security, performance, etc.) to exercise all code paths and generate complete configuration.

> **Tip**: Re-run the tracing agent whenever you update dependencies such as the Copilot SDK or Jackson.
